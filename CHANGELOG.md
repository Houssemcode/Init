# Changelog

## 1.0.0

First release of this fork of [partridgeworks/webos-launcher](https://github.com/partridgeworks/webos-launcher).

**Home screen**
- A centre clock (12-hour with a small AM/PM, or 24-hour) with the date, and one row of apps along the bottom, plus **LG Home** and **Settings** tiles.
- **OLED black** (default) or a calm blue-grey theme.
- Everything adjustable from the remote: clock size, thickness, colour, vertical and horizontal position, and whether to show the date and AM/PM;
  icon size; side and bottom margins; app order and which apps and HDMI inputs appear.

**Wallpaper**
- Plain background, one picture, or a **slideshow from a folder on a USB drive or the TV's storage**, with a folder browser, shuffle and an interval of 10 seconds to 1 hour (including 30 minutes).
- Pictures are read through the Homebrew Channel (the TV's web view cannot open files), shrunk if far larger than the screen, and skipped with a clear
  message if too big or not a picture.

**Speed and memory**
- The app list and the last wallpaper are cached, so the launcher draws its full screen at once; a black splash replaces the grey flash.
- While in the background the launcher draws nothing and holds no wallpaper or tiles.
- Optional **Close LG Home when the app opens**, and **Close LG Home now** (shows the memory freed).

**Experimental: making the launcher the TV's default**
- **Make this launcher the default instead of LG Home:** a small background helper opens the launcher whenever the TV brings LG Home to the front
  (Home, Back, boot). Nothing is replaced or mounted. **Start the launcher helper at boot** is a separate switch (one link in the startup folder).
  After opening the launcher the helper checks that it really appeared and asks again if not. The LG Home tile still opens LG's own Home.
  It writes a log and a `diagnose.sh` report for troubleshooting (see `src/homehook/README.md`). LG Home is never ended while it is the app in front.
- **Alternative method:** the TV's own home-app setting, which may only work on webOS 5 and newer (it did not on webOS 4).

**Targeted at older webOS:** built for, and tested on, an LG TV on webOS 4.x with the Homebrew Channel. Newer versions are untested.
